## Simple Frontend to demo Go API

A very basic HTML, CSS, and JS frontend to interact with an API I made in Go. I basically just trudged through it, becasue I have very little design sense and really hate CSS. I mean who actually likes that god awful language? People that are a lot better at than me, that's who. THis is basically just a form on top for username, email, fullname and a message. The four fields that I built a learning app around in Go. Really like that language. 

The API is located [here](https://github.com/ddcroft73/go-crud-app).
